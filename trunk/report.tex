\title{Report: click-stream data analysis of www.math.ut.ee access logs}

\paragraph*{Introduction}

This document is a result of a small project done in the Combinatiorial
Data Mining Algorithms seminar that took place during the fall semester
of 2009 in the Mathematics and Computer Science faculty of the University
of Tartu. The aim of the project was to analyse the access log files
of the faculty's web site (http://www.math.ut.ee) Apache server in
order to find any meaningful use-cases and to identify possible bottlenecks
in the presentation layer. In order to achieve this, we used a Python-based
Apache log parser and experimented with a number of data mining tools
(such as Apriori and FPgrowth algorithms). More detailed results and
description of the work done follow.
