  abstract = {The proliferation of information on the world wide web has made the
	personalization of this information
	
	space a necessity. One possible approach to web personalization is
	to mine typical user profiles
	
	from the vast amount of historical data stored in access logs. In
	the absence of any a priori knowledge,
	
	unsupervised classification or clustering methods seem to be ideally
	suited to analyze the semi-structured
	
	log data of user accesses. In this paper, we define the notion of

    abstract = {this paper we propose algorithms for generation of frequent itemsets by

successive construction of the nodes of a lexicographic tree of itemsets. We

discuss different strategies in generation and traversal of the lexicographic

tree such as breadth-first search, depth-first search or a combination of

the two. These techniques provide different trade-offs in terms of the I/O,

memory and computational time requirements. We use the hierarchical

structure of the lexicographic tree to...},
