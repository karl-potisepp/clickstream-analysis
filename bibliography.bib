  abstract = {The proliferation of information on the world wide web has made the
	personalization of this information
	
	space a necessity. One possible approach to web personalization is
	to mine typical user profiles
	
	from the vast amount of historical data stored in access logs. In
	the absence of any a priori knowledge,
	
	unsupervised classification or clustering methods seem to be ideally
	suited to analyze the semi-structured
	
	log data of user accesses. In this paper, we define the notion of
